The "JSN_Sensor" folder inside this directory contains an abandoned version of our
WCSA_SDP_2022 project - based on the AVR Pro Micro. It contains a C++ library for
the JSN SR04T sensors, and a .ino sketch to test the library. This was abandoned
in favor of the MPLabXpress PIC16F18345 development board using C. Repo should now
reflect these updates.
